<h1>Quantum Physics Problem</h1>
<p>The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle of mass (m) in a one-dimensional potential well (V(x)) is given by:</p>
<p>[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>(\hbar) is the reduced Planck's constant.</li>
<li>(\psi(x)) is the wavefunction of the particle.</li>
<li>(E) is the energy of the particle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Energy Levels</h2>
<p>For a particle in an infinite potential well of width (L), the allowed energy levels are quantized and given by:</p>
<p>[
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}
]</p>
<p>where (n) is a positive integer ((n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots)).</p>
