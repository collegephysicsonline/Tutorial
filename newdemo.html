<h1>Quantum Physics Problem</h1>

<p>The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle of mass (m) in a one-dimensional potential well (V(x)) is given by:</p>

<p>[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
]</p>

<p>where:
- (\hbar) is the reduced Planck's constant.
- (\psi(x)) is the wavefunction of the particle.
- (E) is the energy of the particle.</p>
