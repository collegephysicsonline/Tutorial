# Quantum Physics Problem

The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle of mass \(m\) in a one-dimensional potential well \(V(x)\) is given by:

\[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]

where:
- \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant.
- \(\psi(x)\) is the wavefunction of the particle.
- \(E\) is the energy of the particle.
