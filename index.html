                <h2>Python Crash Course</h2>
                <p><span style="color:blue">Every beginning has a story. In this crash course of Python, it has its own story. I wanted to start this course for a long time. Then I thought, there are already several courses available online to learn Python. Why would I want to add one more course to the list? It took me several months to decide on this course. The main story behind this course is how I learned Python. I remember the first time I heard the word programming when I was a Bachelor of Science student in Physics in my 3rd year of college. Before that, I only used a computer just to fill out some forms for admission or other purposes. So, when I first tried to learn coding, I had no access to a computer. One of the teachers, who taught programming to us, suggested writing programs on paper first based on the logic he taught in college. So, after returning from college, I tried to recall what the teacher taught in class and the homework assigned to us. Based on the logic he taught in class, I first wrote the flowchart on paper and tried to write the code on paper. But at the very beginning, it was difficult to understand whether my code would work or not. But the next day, I sat in front of the college computer (usually one computer was assigned to 4 students), but my teacher gave me permission to use the computer one hour before the class so that I could write my code in some text editor and check whether my code worked or not. My first programming language was C++. To complete the story, at the end of the final year, I got 92% in the Computational Physics course. Later, I learned Fortran and Python programming languages. Every time I followed the method my teacher taught me in class: writing code and executing a program is a secondary task for a coder or programmer. The main task should be first to understand the basics of coding, then understand the problem to solve, and then write and execute the code. In this crash course of Python, I will try to help you understand the basics of Python, how you can create a flowchart of any concept of coding before writing the code in some text editor, and then execute the code to check whether you are getting the same output you were expecting. I believe that will help you increase your understanding of programming. The first 10 parts of this course will be for beginners, where we will discuss the basic concepts of Python. How you will think to solve some problem assigned to you using any programming language. Here in this course, I will use Python as an example, but you can use similar concepts in any programming language.</span></p>

                <h2>Why this course?</h2>
                <p><span>The aim of this course is to get you up and running with Python swiftly, enabling you to create functional programs such as games, data visualizations, and web applications. Along the way, you'll build a solid programming foundation that will benefit you throughout your life. Python Crash Course is tailored for individuals of any age who are new to Python or programming in general. It's ideal for those eager to grasp the basics quickly to dive into exciting projects and for those who enjoy testing their understanding by tackling meaningful problems. This course is also an excellent resource for middle and high school teachers looking to introduce their students to programming through project-based learning. Additionally, if you're a college student seeking a more approachable introduction to Python than your assigned textbook, this course can make your studies more manageable. After working your way through this Python Crash Course, you should be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and your next programming language will be even easier to grasp.</span></p>

                <h2>Plan for this course</h2>
                <p><span>
                    <h3>Part - 1</h3>
                    In the first part of this course, you will learn the basic programming concepts needed to write your first Python programs. These basic concepts are applicable to any programming language. You will learn about different types of data and how to store data in lists and dictionaries. You will also learn how to use while loops and if statements to test conditions efficiently.

                    You will learn to accept input from users to make your program interactive. You will explore how to write functions to make your program more efficient, allowing you to perform certain actions whenever you call the functions in your code.

                    Next, we will focus on more advanced concepts such as classes, enabling you to create programs that respond to various situations. You will learn to write programs that handle common errors gracefully.

                    At the end of Part 1, we will work together on small projects to help you implement all the concepts learned in this section.

                    <h3>Part - 2</h3>
                    In Part 2, we will apply our concepts to real-life projects. We will work on three projects: 1. Quantum Physics problem-solving, 2. Data visualization, and 3. A small web application called Course Platform.
