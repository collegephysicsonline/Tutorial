# Explanation of hello.py Code

Before diving into more advanced concepts of the Python programming language, let's first ensure that Python is installed correctly and that we can work with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). To do this, we'll start with a simple and well-known program called "Hello, World!". This basic script will help you take your first step in this Python learning journey.

This is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.ÃŸ

```python
# The print() function is a built-in function in Python that outputs text to the console.
# In this case, we are passing the string "Hello, World!" to the print() function.
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Technical Details

1. **print() Function**: 
    - The `print()` function is a built-in function in Python.
    - It is used to output text or other data to the console.
    - In this script, the `print()` function is called with the argument `"Hello, World!"`.

2. **String Argument**:
    - The argument `"Hello, World!"` is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
    - Strings in Python can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

3. **Execution**:
    - When the script is executed, the `print()` function is called.
    - The function processes the string argument and outputs it to the console.

4. **Output**:
    - The result of running this script is that the text `Hello, World!` is displayed in the console.

This script is often used as a first program when learning a new programming language because it demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of the language.
