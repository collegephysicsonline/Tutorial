# Explanation of hello.py Code

This is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

```python
# The print() function is a built-in function in Python that outputs text to the console.
# In this case, we are passing the string "Hello, World!" to the print() function.
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Technical Details

1. **print() Function**: 
    - The `print()` function is a built-in function in Python.
    - It is used to output text or other data to the console.
    - In this script, the `print()` function is called with the argument `"Hello, World!"`.

2. **String Argument**:
    - The argument `"Hello, World!"` is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
    - Strings in Python can be enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

3. **Execution**:
    - When the script is executed, the `print()` function is called.
    - The function processes the string argument and outputs it to the console.

4. **Output**:
    - The result of running this script is that the text `Hello, World!` is displayed in the console.

This script is often used as a first program when learning a new programming language because it demonstrates the basic syntax and structure of the language.
