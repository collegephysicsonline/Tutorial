# Homework: Hello World in Python

## Objective
Learn how to use the `print()` function in Python to display text on the screen.

## For Practice

1. **Basic Hello World**
    - Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

2. **Personalized Greeting**
    - Modify the program to print a personalized greeting. For example, if your name is John, the output should be "Hello, John!".
    ```python
    name = "John"
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    ```

3. **Multiple Lines**
    - Write a Python program that prints the following text on separate lines:
      ```
      Hello, World!
      Welcome to Python programming.
      ```
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("Welcome to Python programming.")
    ```

4. **Using Variables**
    - Store the greeting message in a variable and then print it.
    ```python
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)
    ```

## Problem to solve


5. **Combining Strings**
    - Write a program that combines two strings and prints the result. For example, combine "Hello" and "World" to print "Hello World".
    ```python
    part1 = "Hello"
    part2 = "World"
    print(part1 + " " + part2)
    ### Problems

6. **Printing Quotes**
    - Write a Python program that prints a quote. For example, print "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today." - Franklin D. Roosevelt.

7. **Escape Characters**
    - Write a Python program that prints a string with a newline character and a tab character. For example:
    ```
    Hello,
    World!
    ```

8. **Printing a Backslash**
    - Write a Python program that prints a string containing a backslash. For example, print "This is a backslash: \\".

9. **Formatted Strings**
    - Write a Python program that uses formatted strings to print the result of a calculation. For example, print "The result of 5 + 3 is 8".

10. **Printing a Multiline String**
    - Write a Python program that prints a multiline string using triple quotes. For example:
    ```
    This is a multiline string.
    It can span multiple lines.
    ```
