# Introduction to Python Variables and Data Types

Welcome back! In our previous tutorial, we wrote a simple Python script `hello.py` that printed "Hello, world!" to the console. That was a great start, but now it's time to dive deeper into the world of Python programming. In this section, we'll explore variables and data types, which are fundamental concepts in any programming language.

## What is a Variable?

A variable in Python is like a container that holds data. You can think of it as a label that you attach to a piece of information so you can easily refer to it later. Variables allow you to store, modify, and retrieve data throughout your program.

### Example:
```python
message = "Hello, world!"
print(message)
```

In this example, we created a variable named `message` and assigned it the value `"Hello, world!"`. When we use the `print` function, it outputs the value stored in `message`.

## Data Types

Data types specify the kind of data that can be stored in a variable. Python has several built-in data types, including:

- **Integers**: Whole numbers, e.g., `42`, `-7`
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`
- **Strings**: Text, e.g., `"Hello, world!"`, `"Python"`
- **Booleans**: True or False values, e.g., `True`, `False`

### Example:
```python
age = 25          # Integer
height = 5.9      # Float
name = "Alice"    # String
is_student = True # Boolean
```

In this example, we have created variables of different data types: an integer (`age`), a float (`height`), a string (`name`), and a boolean (`is_student`).

Understanding variables and data types is crucial as they form the building blocks of any Python program. As we continue our journey, we'll see how these concepts are used to create more complex and powerful programs.
