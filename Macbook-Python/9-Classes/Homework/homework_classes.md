## Physics Concepts and Explanations

### 1. Projectile Motion
Projectile motion involves the motion of an object thrown into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The key equations are:
- Horizontal distance: $ x = v_0 \cos(\theta) t $
- Vertical distance: $ y = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $
where $ v_0 $ is the initial velocity, $ \theta $ is the launch angle, $ t $ is time, and $ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity.

### 2. Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion describes the oscillatory motion of a mass-spring system. The displacement $ x $ as a function of time $ t $ is given by:
- $ x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi) $
where $ A $ is the amplitude, $ \omega $ is the angular frequency $ (\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}) $, and $ \phi $ is the phase constant.

### 3. Electric Circuit Analysis
In electric circuits, resistors can be arranged in series or parallel:
- Series: $ R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + \ldots + R_n $
- Parallel: $ \frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n} $

### 4. Gravitational Force
Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force:
- $ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $
where $ G $ is the gravitational constant, $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the masses, and $ r $ is the distance between them.

### 5. Kinematics
Kinematics deals with the motion of objects. Key equations include:

where $ u $ is the initial velocity, $ v $ is the final velocity, $ a $ is the acceleration, and $ t $ is time.

### 6. Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics involves the study of heat transfer. The final temperature $ T_f $ after heat exchange between two bodies can be found using:
- $ m_1 c (T_f - T_1) + m_2 c (T_f - T_2) = 0 $
where $ m $ is mass, $ c $ is specific heat, and $ T $ is temperature.

### 7. Optics
In optics, the focal length $ f $ of a lens is related to the object distance $ d_o $ and image distance $ d_i $ by:
- $ \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} $

### 8. Fluid Mechanics
The buoyant force $ F_b $ on an object submerged in a fluid is given by Archimedes' principle:
