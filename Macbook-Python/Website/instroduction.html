        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="how-programs-work">How Programs Work</h2>
        <p>A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can execute. When a program runs, the following steps generally occur:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Loading</strong>: The program is loaded from storage into the computer's memory. This involves reading the program's executable file from a storage device (such as a hard drive or SSD) and copying it into the computer's RAM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Execution</strong>: The CPU fetches and executes the instructions in the program one by one. This process involves several stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fetch</strong>: The CPU retrieves the next instruction from memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decode</strong>: The CPU decodes the instruction to determine what action is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execute</strong>: The CPU performs the action specified by the instruction, which may involve arithmetic operations, data movement, or control flow changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Store</strong>: The CPU writes the result of the instruction back to memory or a register.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Input/Output</strong>: The program may interact with the user or other systems through input and output operations. This can include reading data from input devices (such as a keyboard or mouse), writing data to output devices (such as a display or printer), or communicating with other programs or network services.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Termination</strong>: The program completes its tasks and terminates, releasing any resources it used. This involves cleaning up memory, closing files, and performing any necessary finalization steps.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 id="compilation-vs-interpretation">Compilation vs. Interpretation</h4>
        <p>Programs can be executed in two main ways: compilation and interpretation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Compilation</strong>: In this approach, the program is translated from a high-level programming language into machine code by a compiler before it is executed. The resulting machine code is stored in an executable file, which can be run directly by the computer's CPU. Examples of compiled languages include C and C++.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: In this approach, the program is executed directly by an interpreter, which reads and executes the high-level instructions one by one. This allows for more flexibility and easier debugging but can be slower than compiled code. Examples of interpreted languages include Python and JavaScript.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 id="just-in-time-jit-compilation">Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation</h4>
        <p>Some programming languages use a hybrid approach called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. In this approach, the program is initially interpreted, but frequently executed parts of the code are compiled into machine code on-the-fly to improve performance. Examples of languages that use JIT compilation include Java and C#.</p>
        
        <h4 id="multithreading-and-concurrency">Multithreading and Concurrency</h4>
        <p>Modern programs often use multithreading and concurrency to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This involves dividing the program into multiple threads or processes that can run in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core CPUs and improving overall performance. The operating system and programming language runtime manage the scheduling and synchronization of these threads to ensure correct execution.</p>
        
        <h4 id="memory-management">Memory Management</h4>
        <p>Memory management is a crucial aspect of how programs work. It involves allocating and deallocating memory as needed by the program. There are two main types of memory management:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Manual Memory Management</strong>: The programmer explicitly allocates and deallocates memory using functions or operators provided by the programming language. This approach is used in languages like C and C++.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)</strong>: The programming language runtime automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, freeing the programmer from manual memory management. This approach is used in languages like Python, Java, and C#.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
